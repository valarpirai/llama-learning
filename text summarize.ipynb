But the wire was too hard, and she couldn't cut it.  \\\"I can't cut this wire, Mommy,\\\" said Lily. \\\"That's okay, sweetie. We can use this wire to make a pretty picture frame instead,\\\" said her mom. Lily was happy to help her mom make a pretty picture frame, and she forgot all about the butterfly.\"\n",
